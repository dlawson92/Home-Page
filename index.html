	<h1>Completed Projects</h1>
	<p>This portfolio page along with the product landing page are two certification projects I've completed for freeCodeCamp. The other 2 projects (Happy Flappy Penguin and Dragon Repeller) are two assignments completed on freeCodeCamp as part of the curriculum.

		<h4>My favorite hobbie is crocheting...</h4>
		<p>I have been crocheting since the age of 18. At this point I would consider myself an advanced crocheter. The picture above is a circular mandala vest (pattern courtesy of The Lavender Chair) that took approximately 40 hours to complete. I've made everything from blankets to clothing to toys, my favorite being small stuffed toys.</p>

	<div class="coding">
		<h4>A close second is coding!</h4>
		<p>I've been studying front end-development for close to a year now, with the aim of becoming a full-stack developer. I have one current certification through freeCodeCamp in HTML and CSS and am currently working towards my certification in Javascript.</p>

	<h4>Thanks are in order!</h4>
		<p>I'd like to use a few lines to thank a few people, first being my mom who has always supported me in my endeavors. The second person I would like to thank is Cindy, who took me in off the streets when I was homeless and waiting for section 8 to come through. I wouldn't be able to work on my coding (and crocheting) and in turn, work on myself if it hadn't have been for you. The last group of people I'd like to thank is my entire unhoused family. Without them, I never would have made it as far, or become as strong as I have. Thank you to everyone.</p>
